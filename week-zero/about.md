# Code The Web: Phase Two

## About

This is a practical, project-based course on modern Javascript and its tooling on both front and back-ends development. 

To mimic real-world software development scenarios in jobs and universities, the teaching approach will be in the style of [guided-learning](http://www.teachingtoolbox.us/direct-vs-guided). This means students will take an active role in the learning process through their own self-discovery of information while the instructor will simply act as a facilitator or guide. Per week, this translates to roughly 20% classroom time (3 hours) and 80% self-learn work (12 hours).

## Expectations

To increase your chance of success throughout the course, you are expected to:

1. ***Self-manage*** how you use your time wisely and build good study habits.
2. ***Self-motivate*** yourself both mentally and physically to commit to the program.
3. ***Self-learn*** the course topics through the resources we provide and also your own research.

> Each Saturday, come to class after having read the materials assigned for that week. Otherwise, it might be challenging to catch up on reading while completing the weekly assignment at the same time especially if you are totally new to programming.

## Attendance & Participation

Your attendance will not be tracked but your performance will. Participation and progress will be measured through Git commits, pull requests, and code reviews. That said, if you decide to not attend class, I would appreciate a simple heads-up on WhatsApp. If you rarely attend the class but are always self-learning at home and performing well â€” Good for you, buddy! Stay home!
