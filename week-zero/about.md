# Code The Web: Phase Two

## About

This course is an eight-week long, project-based, intensive course. It requires roughly 12 hours of work per week on your part. In terms of learning, 20% will be classroom lecture and 80% self-learn.

## Expectations

To increase your chance of success throughout the course, you are expected to:

1. ***Self-manage*** how you use your time wisely and build a study habits.
2. ***Self-motivate*** yourself both mentally and physically to commit to the program.
3. ***Self-learn*** the course topics through the resources we provide and also your own research.

> Each Saturday, come to class after having read the materials assigned for that week. Otherwise, it might be challenging to catch up on reading while completing the weekly assignment at the same time especially if you are totally new to programming.

## Attendance & Participation

To mimic real-world software development scenarios in jobs and universities, I will not be tracking attendance but performance. I will be tracking your performance to measure your participation and progress through Git commits, pull requests, and code reviews. If you decide to not attend class, I would appreciate a simple heads-up. 

If you rarely attend the class but are always self-learning at home and performing well â€” Good for you, buddy! Stay home!
