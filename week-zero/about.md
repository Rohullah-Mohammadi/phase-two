# Course Info

This is a practical, project-based course on Git, modern Javascript as well as relevant tooling in front and back-end development.

To mimic real-world software development scenarios in jobs, universities, or bootcamps, the teaching approach will be in the style of [guided-learning](http://www.teachingtoolbox.us/direct-vs-guided). This means students will take an active role in the learning process through their own self-discovery of information while the instructor will simply act as a facilitator or guide. Per week, this translates to roughly 20% classroom time (3 hours) and 80% self-learn work (12 hours).

## Expectations

To increase your chance of success throughout the course, you are expected to:

1. ***Self-manage*** how you use your time wisely and build good study habits.
2. ***Self-motivate*** yourself both mentally and physically to commit to the program.
3. ***Self-learn*** the course topics through the resources we provide and also your own research.

> Each Saturday, come to class after having read the materials assigned for that week. Otherwise, it might be challenging to catch up on reading while completing the weekly assignment at the same time especially if you are totally new to programming.

## Learning Guide

Each week above you will find learning materials categorized into these different sections:

* :closed_book:  **Required Reading/Challenges** \
Read these before beginning of next Saturday class. As you finish each reading, mark it as complete  using `[x]` in the `readme.md` file, then do a commit push. [Read more about task lists here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-task-lists#creating-task-lists).

* :dart:  **Weekly Mini Projects** \
These are the mini projects we will build this week in class. You are encouraged to pre-watch them.

* :pencil2:  **Homework Exercises** \
Due before beginning of next Saturday class. You **must** participate in Thursday code review session for each homework assignment as this is one of the ways we measure your progress.

* :octocat:  **Optional Resources** \
Additional materials that can help boost understanding of concepts. Though not mandatory, you are welcome to read these — [*Scientia potentia est*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientia_potentia_est).

## Classroom Agenda

Each 3-hour class session will strictly follow the following structure:

* 30 min: Discuss homework challenges from PRs
* 45 min: Mini Project #1
* 5 min: Break 
* 45 min: Mini Project #2
* 5 min: Break 
* 45 min: Mini Project #3 (Self-work)
* 5 min: Practical applications of today's concepts

## Attendance & Participation

Your attendance will not be tracked but your performance will. Participation and progress will be measured through Git commits, pull requests, and code reviews. That said, if you decide to not attend class, I would appreciate a simple heads-up on WhatsApp. If you rarely attend the class but are always self-learning at home and performing well — Good for you, buddy! Stay home!
